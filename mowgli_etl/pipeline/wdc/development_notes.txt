Possible heuristics for product type:
	1 - Last noun in title
	2 - All nouns from the first noun to the first non noun (e.g. "red sky crane handle for support" would be "sky crane handle")
	3 - Same as (2), but using the last sequence instead of the first

TO DO:
	Switch to v1 corpus
	Lots of cleaning to do
	Temporary predicate to make life easier
	Use temp node as dimension
		
	Consider the algebra of containers

	Use v1 data to find labels

	Extractor just returns the path


IMPORTANT:
	Refactor to Pipeline format
	Use PEP-8 Standard
	Build for testing
