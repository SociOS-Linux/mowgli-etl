Possible heuristics for product type:
	1 - Last noun in title
	2 - All nouns from the first noun to the first non noun (e.g. "red sky crane handle for support" would be "sky crane handle")
	3 - Same as (2), but using the last sequence instead of the first

TO DO:
	Refactor heuristics to be more efficient



IMPORTANT:
	Refactor to Pipeline format
	Use PEP-8 Standard
	Build for testing
